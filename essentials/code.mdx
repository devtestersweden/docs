## Basic

### Inserting a Condition Block

To insert a condition block click the `+` button in the editor or click `/` by pressing `CMD+K` on macOS or `CTRL+K` on Windows and Linux.

### Working with Condition Blocks

When a condition block has been added to the editor you will be able to add conditions based on input fields to display or hide content or pages.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Condition Groups

A condition group is a collection of conditions that are evaluated together.

A group can be used to create more complex conditions. Ex

If Full name is empty AND Age is greater than 18, then display the message "You are eligible to vote".

Or even more advanced
