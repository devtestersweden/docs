## Variables in ProcessZen

Variables allow you to use dynamic values throughout your workflow, making it more flexible and personalized.

### Adding Variables

To add a variable:

- Type `{` in the editor (shortcut: SHIFT+[)
- Select the input field you want to reference

### Using Variables

Once you've added a variable, it will dynamically update based on the input field's value. This is particularly useful for:

1. Personalizing messages
   Example: "Hello, {First Name}!"

2. Conditional logic
   Example: IF {Email} contains "@company.com"

3. Populating data in integrations
   Example: Send an email to {Email}

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for your input fields to easily identify them when adding variables
- Test your workflow with different input values to ensure variables are working as expected

Remember, variables provide a powerful way to create dynamic, personalized workflows in ProcessZen.
