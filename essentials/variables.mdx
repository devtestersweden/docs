## Variables in ProcessZen

Variables allow you to dynamically use and manipulate data within your workflows, making them more flexible and powerful.

### Understanding Variables

In ProcessZen, variables are placeholders for data that can change depending on user input or other factors in your workflow. They enable you to create dynamic, responsive processes that adapt to different scenarios.

### Adding Variables

To add variables to your workflow:

1. Open the menu by pressing `/` on your keyboard
2. Alternatively, you can type `` to open the variable menu directly
