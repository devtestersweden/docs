## Variables in ProcessZen

Variables allow you to dynamically use and manipulate data within your workflows, making them more flexible and powerful.

### Understanding Variables

In ProcessZen, variables are placeholders for data that can change depending on user input or other factors in your workflow. They enable you to create dynamic, responsive processes that adapt to different scenarios.

### Adding Variables

To add variables to your workflow:

1. Open the menu by pressing `/` on your keyboard
2. Alternatively, you can type `` to open the variable menu directly

### Types of Variables

1. Input Field Variables
   - These are created from user inputs in your forms
   - Example: `{{user_name}}`, `{{email_address}}`, `{{phone_number}}`

### Using Variables in Your Workflow

You can use variables in various parts of your workflow:

1. Text Fields

   - Example: "Hello `{{user_name}}`, welcome to our service!"

2. Email Templates

   - Example: "Your order #`{{order_id}}` has been shipped to `{{shipping_address}}`."

3. Conditional Logic
   - Example: If `{{total_order}} > 1000`, show VIP customer page

By effectively using variables, you can create dynamic, personalized workflows that adapt to user inputs and changing conditions, enhancing the overall efficiency and user experience of your processes.
