## Input Validation in ProcessZen

Input validation helps maintain data integrity by ensuring that user inputs meet specific criteria before proceeding in the workflow.

### Adding Validation Rules

To add validation to an input field:

- Click on the gear icon right next to the input field

### Types of Validation

1. Type Validation

   - Email: Ensures the input is a valid email address
   - Number: Allows only numeric input
   - Date: Ensures the input is a valid date

2. Length Validation

   - Min length: Sets the minimum number of characters required
   - Max length: Sets the maximum number of characters allowed

3. Custom Validation
   - Regex: Use custom regular expressions for specific validation needs

### Example Validation Rules

1. Email validation:

   - Type: Email

2. Phone number validation:

   - Type: Number
   - Min length: 10
   - Max length: 15

3. Password strength:
   - Min length: 8
   - Custom regex: ^(?=._[A-Za-z])(?=._\d)[A-Za-z\d]{8,}$

By implementing proper validation, you can improve data quality and reduce errors in your workflows.
